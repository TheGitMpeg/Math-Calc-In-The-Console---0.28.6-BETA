5. Y2K38
Prints: "January 19, 2038" is the last date that 32-bit systems support. After that date, 32-bit systems stop working because after the second 2147483647 ("January 19, 2038 at 3:14:07 AM"), skips to second -2147483648 that's "December 13, 1901 at 8:45:52 PM", so you have enough time to upgrade to 64-bit systems (if you want).
6. ForceAction.GlitchTheApplication.StopWorking.ActionInput
The application restarts the AppHome() definition.
7. ForceAction.GlitchTheApplication.StopWorkingBy.InfiniteAppHomeLoops
The application makes its contents flicker. If you are sensitive to flickering effects, don't do this at your PC.
8. ForceAction.GlitchTheApplication.StopWorkingBy.InfiniteQuickOperationsLoops
The application doesn't do anything. But if you're in an operation, it crashes directly.
9. ForceAction.GlitchTheApplication.StopWorkingBy.InfiniteQuickOperationsLoops.InfiniteTrueFalse
The Action Input stops working.
10. ForceAction.GlitchTheApplication.StopWorkingBy.GeneratingInfiniteLoopsWithBlankSpaces
It generates an infinite loop of blank spaces until you kill its process.
11. ForceAction.QuickRestart
It does a quick restart. It has bugs.
