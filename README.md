# Math-Calc-In-The-Console---0.28.6-BETA
This programed called "Math: Calc In The Console" is 100% programmed in Python. To open correctly that .py file, the following requirements are:
1. Python 3.6 or greater
2. To modify the code and upload to GitHub as a fork, a notepad that you can make or modify Python code, for example, Notepad++.

If you don't have these apps, you can neither open correctly this file nor modify code.
ONLY PEOPLE THAT HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF THIS LANGUAGE CAN MODIFY IT.
NOTE: For this moment, this application ONLY WORKS IN WINDOWS.
You can do any pull request, make a new fork for my program and/or contribute to that Python application to add another pre-release or release. BUT OFFENSIVE COMMENTS ARE DENIED AND REPORTED.
If you do a pre-release or release (if you think your modification is a final version), you're very welcome.
For this file, I ONLY ACCEPT PYTHON CODES. You can also add or delete modules.
